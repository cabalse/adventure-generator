# Adventure Generator

** VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS **

This is a semi-demo project exploring the React Flow Framework and OpenAI API.

The Adventure Generator lets the user create a Flow Diagram using nodes that represent Locations, e.g., A Inn, Cave, Castle, Spaceport, etc. Each location is connected with an edge representing a way between two locations, e.g. a road, a piece of evidence, a mission, or someone guiding you. When the diagram is complete, OpenAI is used to write the basic structure for an RPG Adventure based on the locations and the connections between each location.

## Project Structure

The project uses VITE as the basis for the front-end tooling. It's written in Typescript and uses Tailwind CSS.
