The Adventure Generator let the user create a Flow Diagram using nodes that represent Locations, e.g. A Inn, Cave, Castle, Spaceport and so on. Each location is connected with an edge representing a way between two locations e.g. a road, a pieve of evidence, a mission, someone guiding you. When the diagram is complete OpenAI is used to write the basic structure for an RPG Adventure based on the locations and the connections between each location.

## Project Structure

The project uses VITE as the basis for the frontend tooling. Its written in Typescript and using Tailwind CSS.
